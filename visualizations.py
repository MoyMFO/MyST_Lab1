# -- project: This project has been created for calculating measures of orderbooks and public trades. 
#             It is used python as the programming language to implement theoretical measures that describe
#             the market dynamic. Will be found some methods contained in classes for the orderbook and/or 
#             public trade to be analyzed. Finally, there is a Jupyter notebook where all the measures
              are implemented and a few graphics are displayed.                                          -- #
